		<h1>Cross Platform Development</h1>
		
		<h2>Xamarin</h2>
		<p>
			C# Development Platform for Android, iPhone, and Windows applications
			
			Features:
				Compatibility with XCode for building interfaces and Visual Studio for all coding
				Access to all Android, Windows, iPhone APIs
				Shared Projects (see below)
				Xamarin Forms (see below)
				NuGet package management
				
			Pricing:
				Tiered pricing scheme where paying more gives access to more features
				Base tier is free, limited to projects with compiled code of 128 Kbytes
				Recently purchased by Microsoft, subject to change
	
			Shared Projects:
				A special type of project in Xamarin that allows you to simultaneously develop for multiple platforms
				using one code base (or more for more specialized parts for each platform). Helps reduce amount of code 
				to maintain by centralizing certain portions of code. 
				
			Xamarin Forms:
				Special layout type exclusive to Xamarin. Allows shared code to lead to native feel in multiple platforms
				simultaneously. See below for example. The same shared code leads to these three screen layouts. Note the 
				different locations of navigation buttons (Most visible in iPhone app: Sales, Customers, Products)

			Pros:
				Easy to Maintain code for cross-platform applications
				Xamarin forms make creating native feeling apps easy
				Interfaces well with Visual Studio and XCode
				
			Cons:
				Xamarin shared projects are slightly restrictive-- can only do shared code if it is
					implemented in each of the target platforms
				Costs money to use for larger projects
				No compatibility with Android Studios
